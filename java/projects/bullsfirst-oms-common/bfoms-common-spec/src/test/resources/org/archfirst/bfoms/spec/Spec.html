    <h1>Bullsfirst OMS</h1>
    
    <p>
        Bullsfirst OMS is a sample order management system that shows best
        practices in software architecture such as Active Specifications,
        Domain Driven Design and Test Driven Development. It is an application
        that would be owned by a brokerage firm (similar to E*Trade or Fidelity).
        Bullsfirst OMS accepts securities orders from the brokerage firm customers.
        The brokerage firm then places these orders on the Bullsfirst Exchange.
        Brokerage firm customers connect to the OMS using a client application
        to access their accounts, enter trades and monitor positions.
