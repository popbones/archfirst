    <p>
        Bullsfirst OMS is a demonstration only order management system that shows
        best practices in software architecture such as Executable Specifications,
        Domain Driven Design and Test Driven Development.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        The OMS is an application that is typically owned by a brokerage firm
        (similar to E*Trade and Fidelity). It is used to accept securities orders
        from customers. The brokerage firm is an intermediary that places these
        orders on the Bullsfirst Exchange. The Exchange (similar to NYSE) matches
        buy and sell orders from all brokers. When a match is made, a trade is
        executed and confirmations are sent to the buy and sell side firms.
        Brokerage firm customers use the Bullsfirst Client to access their
        accounts, enter trades and monitor positions.
