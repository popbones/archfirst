    <h1>Transfer Cash - External to Brokerage</h1>

    <p>
        When $<span concordion:execute="transfer(#TEXT)">100.00</span> is transfered
        from an external account to a newly opened brokerage account, the cash position
        in the brokerage account becomes
        <span concordion:assertEquals="getBrokerageAccountCashPosition()">$100.00</span>.
        In addition a cash transfer of
        <span concordion:assertEquals="getExternalAccountCashTransferAmount()">($100.00)</span>
        is recorded on the external account
        and a cash transfer of
        <span concordion:assertEquals="getBrokerageAccountCashTransferAmount()">$100.00</span>
        is recorded on the brokerage account.
