        A brokerage account holds assets in the form of cash and securities.
    </p>

    <p>
        The total amount of cash held in the account is called its
        <b>Cash Position</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Securities are held in groups of shares called <b>lots</b>
        (or <b>Lot Positions</b>).
        A lot consists of shares of the same security purchased or
        acquired in a single transaction. For example, a lot of 500
        shares of AAPL purchased on 12/01/2010. Lots have a purchase price
        (price paid per share) associated with them. We use the term
        <b>Instrument Position</b> to denote the total quantity of a
        security held in an account. For example, an account holding
        two lots of AAPL containing 100 and 200 shares respectively,
        is said to have a position of 300 shares in AAPL.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The collection of all assets in an account, including its cash
        and lot positions, is called the <b>Account Position</b>.
