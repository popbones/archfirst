Copy the js files you require for your project from this running sample demo. 

In case you don't need a feature, you can exclude those js file plug-ins (e.g. sorting, grouping,resizing,etc.).

You can create your own version of combined js/css files by modifying the combine.bat file as per your need.

Once you get the combined version of the file you can run it through any minifier, to get the minified version.

This demo show cases the flexible architecture of the grid, where you can add extensions very easily, 
e.g. I have add the date range selecter filter, custom cell renderers, etc.
